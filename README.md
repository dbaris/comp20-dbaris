1) What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
This repo allowed for private code sharing so that the assignments could be seen by and graded on computers other than the original one. It also held backup versions of the code that I could revert to if necessary. 

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
I really enjoyed the personal website project because it had the most room for individual creativity and it was something I could actually use outside of class.

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I feel much more confident in my ability to figure things out for myself by googling, following examples from the course Github, and experiementing. I also actually understand how the internet works now!

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing I learned this semseter was how to teach myself. Since lectures didn't cover all the material necessary to finish the assignments, I got a lot of practice teaching myself. For example, I spend a lot of time reading the Google maps API for the Red Line map assignment, and on the team project I was able to build my own countdown time by reading through Bootstrap and Stack Overflow posts.

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'd be interested in learning more about security, and I want to work on getting more practice with web development.
